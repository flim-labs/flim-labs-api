# FPGA firmwares

This is a table showing all the availale firmwares for the FPGA and how to use them in the different acquisition modes

| Firmware | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| [frequency_meter.flim](/FPGA_firmwares/frequency_meter.flim) | Flash this firmware on the FPGA when performing [measure-frequency](/Measure_frequency/measure-frequency.py) acquisition mode |
| [photons_tracing.flim](/FPGA_firmwares/photons_tracing.flim) | Flash this firmware on the FPGA when performing [photons_tracing](/Photons_tracing/photons_tracing.py) acquisition mode | 
| [spectroscopy_40MHz.flim](/FPGA_firmwares/spectroscopy_40MHz.flim) | Flash this firmware on the FPGA for performing [spectroscopy](/Spectroscopy/spectroscopy.py) acquisition mode when the pulsed laser's frequency is set to 40 MHz |
| [spectroscopy_80MHz.flim](/FPGA_firmwares/spectroscopy_80MHz.flim) | Flash this firmware on the FPGA for performing [spectroscopy](/Spectroscopy/spectroscopy.py) acquisition mode when the pulsed laser's frequency is set to 80 MHz |
